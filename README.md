# Human Decoder: Exploring personality traits.
Humans are complicated, some things about us are so intricate that sometimes they doesn't make sense at all. But, what if you could make sense of it, with the help of machine learning?

## Description
<b>Human Decoder</b> is an ML application available at my [personal website](https://ivanachille.com/humandecoder-ps) that predicts whether a subject would be able to adapt quickly to a new environment, by digesting different personality traits as input information. The model is trained on the data of the [2013 FSEV UK Students Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey) to predict this behaviour.
